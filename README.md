# <img src="public/images/Vault-LogoMark_onDark.svg" width="30" align="left" style="margin-right: 12px;"/> Vault MCP Server

The Vault MCP Server is a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction)
server implementation that provides integration with HashiCorp
Vault for managing secrets and mounts. This server uses both stdio and StreamableHTTP
transports for MCP communication, making it compatible with Claude for Desktop 
and other MCP clients.

> **Security Note:** At this stage, the MCP server is intended for local use only. If using the StreamableHTTP transport, always configure the MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable to restrict access to trusted origins only. This helps prevent DNS rebinding attacks and other cross-origin vulnerabilities.

> **Security Note:** Depending on the query, the MCP server may expose certain Vault data, including Vault secrets, to the MCP client and LLM. Do not use the MCP server with untrusted MCP clients or LLMs.

> **Legal Note:** Your use of a third party MCP Client/LLM is subject solely to the terms of use for such MCP/LLM, and IBM is not responsible for the performance of such third party tools. IBM expressly disclaims any and all warranties and liability for third party MCP Clients/LLMs, and may not be able to provide support to resolve issues which are caused by the third party tools. 

> **Caution:**  The outputs and recommendations provided by the MCP server are generated dynamically and may vary based on the query, model, and the connected MCP client. Users should thoroughly review all outputs/recommendations to ensure they align with their organization’s security best practices, cost-efficiency goals, and compliance requirements before implementation.

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.24 or later (if building from source)
- Docker
- HashiCorp Vault server running locally or remotely
- A valid Vault token with appropriate permissions

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-mcp-server.git
    cd vault-mcp-server
    ```

2. Build the binary:
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

3. Run the server:

    **Stdio mode (default):**
    ```bash
    ./vault-mcp-server
    # or explicitly
    ./vault-mcp-server stdio
    ```

    **HTTP mode:**
    ```bash
    ./vault-mcp-server http --transport-port 8080
    # or using make
    make run-http
    ```

## Environment Variables

The server can be configured using environment variables:

- `VAULT_ADDR`: Vault server address (default: `http://127.0.0.1:8200`)
- `VAULT_TOKEN`: Vault authentication token (required in stdio mode; optional in HTTP mode — if set it bypasses browser OAuth and is used for requests)
- `VAULT_NAMESPACE`: Vault namespace (optional)
- `TRANSPORT_MODE`: Set to `http` to enable HTTP mode
- `TRANSPORT_HOST`: Host to bind to for HTTP mode (default: `127.0.0.1`)
- `TRANSPORT_PORT`: Port for HTTP mode (default: `8080`)
- `MCP_ENDPOINT`: HTTP server endpoint path (default: `/mcp`)
- `MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of allowed origins for CORS (default: `""`)
- `MCP_CORS_MODE`: CORS mode: `strict`, `development`, or `disabled` (default: `strict`)
- `MCP_TLS_CERT_FILE`: Location of the TLS certificate file (e.g. `/path/to/cert.pem`) (default: `""`)
- `MCP_TLS_KEY_FILE`: Location of the TLS key file (e.g. `/path/to/key.pem`)(default: `""`)
- `MCP_RATE_LIMIT_GLOBAL`: Global rate limit (format: `rps:burst`) (default: `10:20`)
- `MCP_RATE_LIMIT_SESSION`: Per-session rate limit (format: `rps:burst`) (default: `5:10`)

OAuth / browser login (see [Browser OAuth](#browser-oauth-vault-login)):

- `MCP_AUTH_SECRET`: base64url (32-byte) key that seals OAuth tokens. Optional; if unset the server generates one at startup and logs it at INFO. Set it to keep bearer tokens valid across restarts.
- `MCP_SERVER_URL`: public base URL advertised in OAuth metadata/redirects (default: derived per-request from the `Host` / `X-Forwarded-*` headers)
- `MCP_AUTH_CODE_TTL`: lifetime of authorization codes / login state (default: `5m`)
- `MCP_AUTH_ACCESS_TTL`: lifetime of bearer access tokens (default: `12h`)
- `VAULT_CACERT`: PEM CA bundle path used to verify the upstream Vault TLS cert (e.g. `/viasat/certs/viasat.io.pem`)
- `VIASAT_IO_CACERT_FILE` / `VIASAT_IO_CACERT_URL`: location and source URL of the Viasat private CA bundle; bootstrap it out-of-process (see `scripts/fetch-secrets/` or `docker-compose-viasat.yaml`)
- `VAULT_AUTH_LDAP_MOUNT` (default `ldap`), `VAULT_AUTH_USERPASS_MOUNT` (default `userpass`), `VAULT_OIDC_MOUNT` (default `oidc`), `VAULT_OIDC_ROLE` (optional): Vault auth method mounts used by the login page

## HTTP Mode Configuration

In HTTP mode, the `/mcp` endpoint always requires authentication. You can satisfy this requirement in one of two ways:

- **Browser OAuth** (recommended for interactive MCP clients): the client is redirected to `/vault/login` and then calls `/mcp` with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` minted by this server.
- **Token bypass** (for clients that cannot do OAuth): provide a Vault token externally via `VAULT_TOKEN` (env) or the `X-Vault-Token` request header.

Bearer tokens are sealed with `MCP_AUTH_SECRET`. If you let the server auto-generate it on each start, previously issued bearer tokens stop working after restart (clients will re-authenticate).

Upstream Vault connection details used for the login flow are configured via environment variables (`VAULT_ADDR`, `VAULT_NAMESPACE`, `VAULT_CACERT`, etc.).

### Middleware Stack

The HTTP server includes a comprehensive middleware stack:

- **CORS Middleware**: Enables cross-origin requests with appropriate headers
- **Bearer (OAuth) Middleware**: Unseals the bearer token and injects the Vault credentials into the request context (or bypasses OAuth when a Vault token is supplied externally)
- **Vault Context Middleware**: Extracts Vault configuration and adds to request context
- **Logging Middleware**: Structured HTTP request logging

## Browser OAuth (Vault login)

In HTTP mode the server can act as its own **OAuth 2.1 Authorization Server** so an
interactive MCP client (Claude, an agentic CLI, etc.) is handed a URL to authenticate
against your Vault in the browser — no token copy/paste required. The Vault token obtained
during login is encrypted (AES-256-GCM) into the OAuth bearer token; nothing is stored
server-side (the flow is fully stateless).

`MCP_AUTH_SECRET` seals the issued bearer tokens. It is optional; if unset the server generates one at
startup and logs it at INFO (set it to keep bearer tokens valid across restarts).

If you cannot do OAuth, you can bypass the browser flow by providing a Vault token externally
(`VAULT_TOKEN` env var or `X-Vault-Token` request header).

Token bypass (no browser OAuth):

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.seceng-iam.viasat.io
export VAULT_TOKEN=hvs....
docker compose up --build
```

Browser OAuth:

```bash
export VAULT_ADDR=https://vault.seceng-iam.viasat.io
# Optional: set to keep bearer tokens valid across restarts
export MCP_AUTH_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=')
docker compose up --build
```

### How it works

1. The MCP client discovers `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp` and
   `/.well-known/oauth-authorization-server`, dynamically registers (`/register`), and opens
   `/authorize` (authorization code + PKCE).
2. `/authorize` redirects the browser to `/vault/login`, which offers three ways to authenticate:
   - **LDAP** — `auth/<ldap mount>/login/<user>`
   - **Userpass** — `auth/<userpass mount>/login/<user>`
   - **OIDC (SSO)** — Vault `auth/<oidc mount>/oidc/auth_url`; the browser is sent to your IdP
     and returns to `/vault/oidc/callback`. The callback URL is computed **dynamically from the
     current host**, so it works behind any hostname/reverse proxy.
3. On success the client receives an authorization code, exchanges it at `/token`, and uses the
   returned `Bearer` token on `/mcp`. An invalid/expired token yields `401` with a
   `WWW-Authenticate` challenge so the client re-authenticates.

> **OIDC note:** the dynamic callback `https://<host>/vault/oidc/callback` must be present in the
> Vault OIDC role's `allowed_redirect_uris`. Set the role via `VAULT_OIDC_ROLE`.

### TLS to a private Vault (the Viasat CA)

To trust `https://vault.seceng-iam.viasat.io`, mount the Viasat private CA bundle and point
`VAULT_CACERT` at it. Bootstrap the CA bundle out-of-process (for example via `scripts/fetch-secrets/`
or the `certs-puller` service in `docker-compose-viasat.yaml`). The Vault MCP server will fail fast
if a CA bundle path is configured but missing on disk.


## Integration with Visual Studio Code

1. In your project workspace root, create or open the `.vscode/mcp.json` configuration file. Alternatively, to add an MCP to your user configuration, run the `MCP: Open User Configuration` command, which opens the mcp.json file in your user profile. If the file does not exist, VS Code creates it for you.

Streamable HTTP mode supports browser OAuth; OAuth-capable MCP clients will be directed to `/vault/login` to authenticate. If you run the server with `VAULT_TOKEN`, clients can skip OAuth.

1. Save `mcp.json` file.

1. Restart Visual Studio Code (or reload the window).

**Note:** Visual Studio Code will prompt you for the VAULT_TOKEN once and store it securely in the client.

## Integration with Gemini extensions


For security, avoid hardcoding your credentials, create or update `~/.gemini/.env` (where ~ is your home or project directory) for storing Vault Address, Token and Namespace

```
# ~/.gemini/.env
VAULT_ADDR=your_vault_addr_here
VAULT_TOKEN=your_vault_token_here
VAULT_NAMESPACE=your_vault_namespace_here
```

Install the extension & run Gemini

```
gemini extensions install https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-mcp-server
gemini
```


## Working with Docker

Build the docker image:

```bash
make docker-build
```

Build the image with a custom registry:
```bash
make docker-build DOCKER_REGISTRY=your-registry.com
```

Push the image to a custom registry:
```bash
make docker-push DOCKER_REGISTRY=your-registry.com
```

Run the Vault container and get the root token:

```bash
docker network create mcp
docker run --cap-add=IPC_LOCK --name=vault-dev --network=mcp -p 8200:8200 hashicorp/vault server -dev
docker logs vault-dev
```

Run the Vault MCP server:

```bash
# Option A: token bypass (no browser OAuth)
docker run --network=mcp -p 8080:8080 -e VAULT_ADDR='http://vault-dev:8200' -e VAULT_TOKEN='hvs....' -e TRANSPORT_MODE='http' vault-mcp-server:dev

# Option B: browser OAuth (MCP_AUTH_SECRET optional)
docker run --network=mcp -p 8080:8080 -e VAULT_ADDR='http://vault-dev:8200' -e MCP_AUTH_SECRET="$(openssl rand -base64 32 | tr '+/' '-_' | tr -d '=')" -e TRANSPORT_MODE='http' vault-mcp-server:dev
